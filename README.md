# number_guessing_game
A number guessing game

This was my frist ever Python progect as well as my very first time using Github as a way to post and share my progects.
Changes to it and new projects will come as I get better and learn how to further navgate Github.

-> How it works :
This is a very simple progect and a easy-to-play game.
To play it, you simply have to run the code and read it on the terminal, the following it's instructions until the game is over.
